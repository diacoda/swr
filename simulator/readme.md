DetermineWithdrawalRate
Given a portfolio allocation with fees and returns, inflation, time horizon, withdrawal method and frequency, rebalancing method
Calculate a withdrawal rate with a specified success rate limit (x% of the time given the conditions above, this withdrawal rate is successful).
Start from 6% and go down in increments until we reach the limits
Alternatively we can start from a very low withdrawal rate and keep growing till we reach the limit;
Success rate limits such as: 100%, 99%, 98%, 95%, 90%.
